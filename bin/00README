Version 3.006 Release for linux and mac with 64 and 32 bit

*               *                                             *                 
*               *    Program:  LaGriT V3.006   Linux m64      *                 
*               *    date_compile: 2012/07/26  gfort 4.5      *                

Now includes netcdf and exodus libs for writing exodus mesh 
files and reading and writing facesets.
Dump exodus files with/without facesets, fast/slow options:
Syntax:
  dump / exo / ifile / cmoname / facesets / on
  dump / exo / ifile / cmoname / facesets / off
  dump /exo / ifile / cmoname / facesets / on file1,file2,...filen
  dump /exo / ifile / cmoname / facesets / off file1,file2,...filen

Added line sort by nodes or elements for creating valid polygons 
that can be read and used by other routines. 
Syntax:
  sort / line_graph / cmo / ascending | descending / [key] / [nodes/elements]

Added option for massage to refine based on an attribute field. 
Syntax:
  massage / [bisection length/field name] / merge_length / toldamage / ...

Under development massage2 syntax for incremental refinement strategies.
Syntax in work: 
  massage2/ [file name] / [Target Length Scale]/[field name]/ &
     merge_length/toldamage/[tolroughness]/[ifirst,ilast,istride]/ ...

Code improvements related to recon 0 and recon 1 will 
result in slightly different but better connectivity results.

Memory and bug fixes related to 64 bit code changes.
Improved error catching for common routines.

============================================================
Version 3.001 Release (linux only)

Major changes to most parts of the code to enable 64 bit compile.
Added memory / print option as check for correct linking for 64 bit.
Added additional memory and error checking.

This version includes the ability to read and write Exodus files.
See COPYRIGHT statements at end of this file.



============================================================
Version 2.200 Release

*               *                                             *                 
*               *    Program:  LaGriT V2.200   Linux m32      *                 
*               *    date_compile: 2010/11/22                 *     

This is the last major release before code is changed for 64 bit work.

dump/fehm, dump/zone_outside
Write outside area vectors based on voronoi instead of median connections.

cmo/addatt/voronoi_varea
create node attributes xn_varea, yn_varea, zn_varea indicating triangle face directions.

interpolate/
Changed interpolate to "find" more points on edges
this will permit nodes to find a nearest edge or point and be
"inside" the triangle for extreme small or large numbers where
epsilon values are difficult to evaluate correctly.
Fixed bug that sometimes saved wrong candidate number not associated
with the value that was used. Can happen where multiple candidates
are found for the sink node, and where the first is not used. 

extract/surfmesh
Now creates attributes to hold element local face numbers of 3D input
mesh that occur on either side of output mesh face, idface0 and idface1.
Now copies user-created node-based attributes from source.

dump 2 and 3 token for avs, lagrit, gmv


============================================================
Version 2.106 Release


*               *    Program:  LaGriT V2.106   Linux m32      *
*               *    date_compile: 2010/06/29                 *


New code wrappers include  
cmo/attribute_union
read for 3 tokens 
compute / linear_extrapolate
grid2grid/ tree_to_fe 
grid2grid/ quadtotri4 

Added error checking to associated routines 

============================================================
Version 2.105 Release
Minor update to LaGriT library with enhancements to the pset routine
and adding ccoef attributes when writing stor files.

============================================================
Version 2.100 Release
This is a major update to LaGriT and the lg_util library. 
Major changes have been made in the core memory management routines to allow 
development for a 64 bit release.  These changes will be invisible to most users 
but allows better reporting of errors and memory usage for useful diagnostic information.

NOTE: SUNOS has been updated to Studio 11 
      you must use libs for Studio 10 or higher running on OS 8 or higher
      use % source /n/env/local.sunwspro.11
