# Test the rotateln command. This test was written in the process of tracking   
# down a bug where part of the point distribution would rotate in one direction 
# and the other part would rotate in the opposite direction. This test should   
# work now although it did not work before this bug was fixed.                  
# Create a cube of points and rotate it 90 degrees about the z-axis.
