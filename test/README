Directory to hold unit testing files.

level01 tests are required for QA projects and test basic and required functionality.
level02 tests are for certain select algorithms and advanced applications
level03 tests are created by student or guest users

Tests may be run from this directory using suite.py 
Tests may be run within the level01 or level02 using scripts in those directories.
Single test cases are run within any subdirectory.
  Compare output in the test directory to files in the reference subdirectory. 
  Run lagrit exectuable and compare the result:
    lagrit < input.lgi
    diff outx3dgen reference/outx3dgen


NOTES:
	Windows doesn't automatically see .py files as python, so unless .py files are associated with the correct executable the shell command should be "python <target-script>"
