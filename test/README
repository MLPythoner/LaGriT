Directory to hold unit testing files.

level01 tests are required for QA projects and test basic and required functionality.
level02 tests are for certain select algorithms and advanced applications
level03 tests are created by student or guest users

run_test.py writes 2 summary files: diffout_$OS.txt and stdout_$OS.txt

TO RUN AND CHECK ALL LEVEL01 AND LEVEL02: 
     edit suite.py to assign xlagrit to executable
     ./suite.py -f
 
TO RUN AND CHECK LEVEL01 OR LEVEL02:   
     cd [level01 or level02]
     edit run_test.py to assign xlagrit to executable
     clean_testdirs.scr ; run_test.py ; check_test.py;

TO RUN AND CHECK SINGLE TEST:   
  Single test cases are run within any subdirectory.
  Run lagrit exectuable and compare to files in reference directory. 
    lagrit < input.lgi
    diff outx3dgen reference/outx3dgen


NOTES:
	Windows doesn't automatically see .py files as python, so unless .py files are associated with the correct executable the shell command should be "python <target-script>"
