This directory contains LaGriT source .f, .f90, and .c files
There are include files .h, .csh, and lagrit*.h files for OS and date tags.

Makefile, Makefile.depends, and buildbin are used to compile.
The Makefile format requires GNU Make version 3.79.1 or later

The compiler flags and compiler locations for SunOS, Linux, and Darwin (mac)
are defined in these files. The make utility will maintain object files
as defined in OBJDIR. There is a seperate directory for each set
of optimized and debug for each OS platform. make will then check the
object files in the appropriate directory for updates. 

type 'make help' to see a listing of make options

In general to update libs and executable on each platform
    make install (update optimized lib and put into LIBDIR) 
    make COPT=-g install (update debug lib and put into LIBDIR)
    buildbin or buildbin opt (build executable into current dir) 

Note: lagrit.h has tags that can be used to set program OS and DATE tags.
This directory contains lagrit_lin.h, lagrit_mac.h, lagrit_sun.h 
which are used at compile time to update these tags. The file
lagrit.template.h preserves the template for these files. Modify
lagrit.h to define your own tags for the LaGriT runtime banner.
