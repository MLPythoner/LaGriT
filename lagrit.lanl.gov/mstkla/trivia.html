How to pronounce MSTKLA?

<P>Well.....
<BR>MSTKLA is the precursor to MSTK. It is hoped that the underlying structure
of MSTK will be all new code independent of LaGriT. However, since we are
using LaGriT as the underlying structure for now, the toolkit is called
MSTKLA.

<P>M-S-T-K rolls off the tongue nicely, not so M-S-T-K-L-A. Therefore,
judging by the people's first reaction to the name (the second reaction
is Blechhhch!!), why not pronounce it as <I>misticlaa</I>?

<P>Rao

<P>P.S.: Sorry, I am lousy at christening pieces of code!! Just take a
look at my API...
