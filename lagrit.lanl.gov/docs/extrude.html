<blockquote>This command takes a topologically 1d or 2d mesh (a line, a
set of line segments, or a planar or non-planar surface) and extrudes it
into three dimensions along either the normal to the curve or surface (default),
along a user defined vector, or to a set of points that the user has specified.</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>If the extrusion was along the normal of the surface or along
a user defined vector, the command can optionally find the external surface
of the volume created and return that to the user.</blockquote>

<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">mesh1</font> is the name of the
resulting mesh.
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">mesh2</font> is the name of
the initial mesh. This mesh must be made up of <b>lines, tris, quads, or
hybrids</b>.
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">const</font></b> is a
keyword that indicates that the distance from each of the points in the
initial mesh along the extruding vector will be equal to offset.Therefore,
if you wanted the extruded mesh to have the same surface or edge characteristics
as the original mesh on both the initial and newly formed surface or edge,
you would use <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">const</font></b>.
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">min</font></b> is a keyword
and indicates that the minimum distance along the extruding vector to a
reference plane that is perpendicular to the extruding vector will be equal
to offset. This means that if you want an extruded mesh with at least one
flat side, you would use <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">min</font></b>.
This also means that if you use <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">min</font></b>,
extrude computes the "bottom point" on the initial mesh, or the point closest
to the reference plane, and then extrudes that point by min, all the other
points will therefore be extruded by a larger distance. This avoids the
problem of having the initial mesh intersect the reference plane that forms
the "bottom" of the created mesh.
<p><b>interp</b> is a keyword and indicates a different kind of extrusion.
Instead of giving the initial mesh a direction in which to be extruded,
this keyword specifies that the initial mesh is made up of two sets of
points to be connected. These point sets are defined by <b>range1</b> and
<b>range2</b>.
The ranges can be defined using the standard LaGriT techniques of <b>pset</b>,
<b>get</b>,
&lt;<font face="courier, monospace">pset name</font>> or <font face="courier, monospace">ifirst</font>,
<font face="courier, monospace">ilast</font>,
<font face="courier, monospace">istride</font>.
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">layers </font><font face="times, serif">is
the number of layers of elements that will be placed between the original
two surfaces. This is a good point distribution technique. The final number
of layers of points will be equal to layers+1. It must be an integer.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">offset</font> is the length
of extrusion. It can either be an integer or a real.
<p><b>volume</b> is a keyword and indicates that the volume that was extruded
is to be returned to the user (i.e., the operation will result in either
a topologically 2d (quad) mesh if the initial mesh was topologically 1d,
or a topologically 3d (prism or hex) mesh if the initial mesh was topologically
2d). <b>bubble</b> is a keyword and indicates that the external surface
of the volume created will be returned. If bubble is used, hextotet will
be called on the final surface, as well as extract.
<p>The final argument is optional. It must either be the keyword
<b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">norm</font></b>,
or a three valued vector (in cartesian space) specifying a direction. The
default, if no argument is provided, is <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">norm</font></b>.
If <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">norm</font></b> is chosen,
the element area weighted normal to the surface or curve is computed, and
the initial mesh is extruded in that direction. Otherwise, if a vector
value is specified, the vector is normalized, and its direction used to
extrude the initial mesh.
<p>NOTES:
<blockquote STYLE="margin-left: 0.79in">This code works on meshes containing
lines, quads, triangles, or hybrid polygons. If there are lines in the
initial mesh, they become quads; tris become prisms; and quads become hexes.
If bubble is used, however, lines are not permitted because they do not
result in a mesh that extract and hextotet agree with. The code will error
out in this situation.</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>It is very possible to create an invalid mesh object with this
command, especially if the initial mesh is a multivalued surface, or if
the extruding vector is in a direction parallel to the plane the initial
surface is in. You have been warned.</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>If the <b>interp</b> keyword is used, the code expects the
number of points in <b>range1</b> and <b>range2</b> to be equal, and to
correspond such that the first point in <b>range1</b> will connect to the
first point in <b>range2 </b>in the final mesh object, etc. Other setups
will result in a twisted, perhaps invalid mesh object.</blockquote>

<blockquote><b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">extrude</font></b>/<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">cmo_hex</font>/<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">cmo_quad</font>/<b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">const</font></b>/<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">5.0</font>/<b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">volume</font></b></blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>This would result in hexes being created out of the initial
quad sheet. First, since <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">const</font></b>
and <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">volume</font></b> are
used, the quad sheet will be extruded a constant amount from each point.
Second, since the extruding vector and <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">norm</font></b>
are omitted, the extrusion will occur on the average normal to the plane.
Therefore, this command will result in a mesh of hexahedrons extruded 5.0
units in an orthogonal direction. (Or, more succinctly, a mesh of parallelopipeds
of height 5.)</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>This command would result in prisms being created out of the

because the vector 1, 2, -1 is specified, the extrusion will be in that
direction (again the magnitude is not important, the vector is normalized
to a unit vector), not in the direction of the average normal.</blockquote>

the quad sheet. Second, since the extruding vector and <b><font face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">norm</font></b>
