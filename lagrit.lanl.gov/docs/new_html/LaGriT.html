<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>LaGriT</b> is a library
of user callable tools that provide mesh generation, mesh optimization
and dynamic mesh maintenance in three dimensions for a variety of applications.
Geometric regions within arbitrarily complicated geometries are defined
as combinations of bounding surfaces, where the surfaces are described
analytically or as collections of points in space. A variety of techniques
for distributing points within these geometric regions are provided. Mesh
generation uses a Delaunay tetrahedralization algorithm that respects material
interfaces and assures that there are no internal negative coupling coefficients.
The data structures created to implement this algorithm are compact and
powerful and expandable to include hybrid meshes as well as tetrahedral
meshes. Mesh refinement and smoothing are available to modify the mesh
to provide more resolution in areas of interest. Mesh refinement adds nodes
to the mesh based on geometric criteria such as edge length or based on
field variable criteria such change in field. Mesh smoothing moves nodes
to adapt the mesh to field variable measures, and, at the same time, maintains
quality element shape. Mesh elements may become distorted as mesh nodes
move during a time dependent simulation or are added as a result of refinement
operations. Mesh reconnection via a series of edge flips will maintain
the Delaunay criterion of the mesh. An additional requirement of time dependent
simulations is that as interface surfaces move, the corresponding region
definitions must respond dynamically. As surfaces collide, the mesh must
respond by merging points and effectively squeezing out the material between
the colliding surfaces. LaGriT provides the necessary tools for time dependent
simulations.</font></blockquote>
