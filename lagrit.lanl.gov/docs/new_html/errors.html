ERRORS
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote>Errors in Parsing or Executing Commands:
<br>These errors cause an error message to be written to the output batch
file, called logx3dgen by default and to the standard output file.&nbsp;
The messages are self-explanatory and will alert the user to the required
change.&nbsp; For example one of the errors related to the region command
is "<i>token </i>is an invalid operation or a non-defined surface or region."&nbsp;&nbsp;
In this case the user must inspect the corresponding command in the vicinity
of <i>token </i>which is the place in parsing the string that LaGriT could
not proceed, to see if there might be a spelling error in specifying a
operator, region name or surface name or perhaps the user left out an operator.&nbsp;
If the correct commands should read:
<br>surface/s1/reflect/box/0,0,0/1,1,1
<br>surface/s2/intrface/box/.2,.2,.2/.4,.4,.4/
<br>region/r1/le s1 and ge s2
<br>region/r2/ le s2
<br>If the user had mistakenly typed:
<br>region/r1/le s1 and gg s2
<br>the error "REGION&nbsp;ERROR: gg is an invalid operation or a non-defined
surface or region" would appear
<br>followed by "error in command&nbsp;:&nbsp;region/r1/le s1 and gg s2
<p>Out of Memory Errors:
<br>If a&nbsp; user specifies a probelem that is too large, LaGriT will
fail with and "MALLOCF: Out of memory" or "REALLOCF: Reallocation error
- aborting" mesage.&nbsp; The user must decrease the size of the problem
or move to a more powerful platform.
<p>Fatal Memory Management Errors:
<br>Fatal memory management errors are signaled by a message containing
":PANIC!"&nbsp; This type of error should be reported to the code manager,
and the report should include all files and other information necessary
to reproduce the error.
