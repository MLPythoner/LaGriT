and&nbsp; Criteria - Algorithms</FONT></FONT></B>
<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT FACE="Times New Roman,Times">The Refine command for the
grid generation code LaGriT uses various criteria to tag grid elements
for refinement or derefinement. When utilizing unstructured grids generated
by LaGriT for applications such as solution of partial differential equations
(PDE) for physical systems, it is desirable to modify the grid in order
to optimize it for the particular problem based on several principles.
The goal is to produce a better solution by creating better grid elements
in various regions of the domain of the PDE's. This can involve physical
criteria such as choosing smaller elements where physical variables are
rapidly changing or larger elements where the variables are relatively
constant in order not to waste computational effort. Grid elements can
also be chosen on various geometric criteria related to their shape such
as different formulations of an aspect ratio. In time dependent problems,
it may be necessary to refine and derefine the grid after each time step
in order to follow various changing phenomena such as moving concentration
fronts, shock waves, or advancing oxide layers. These factors make mesh
refinement crucial to the practical solution of physical modeling problems.
We therefore will detail several algorithms that are currently implemented
for identifying which grid elements should be refined or derefined based
on geometric and physical criteria. New algorithms will be added to this
list and the current ones modified as we obtain feed back from users.</FONT>
