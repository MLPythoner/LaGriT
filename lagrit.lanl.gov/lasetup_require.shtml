        <h1>X3dsetup Requirements</h1>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>To run lasetup, you will need: </p>   
		<p>the proper version of lasetup. Irix5.3, Irix6.x, Sunultracreator, and IBM <br />
		  versions are available. </p>
		<p>a Unix workstation. You should have no problem with Silicon Graphics (SGI) <br />
		  machines. Sun Ultra Creator systems also work. IBM workstations have <br />
		  been problematical in the past. You must have the 3D option. It may or <br />
		  may not work, depending on things that I don't understand. I haven't made <br />
		  a DEC version, but it should be possible. HP should work someday when <br />
		  HP starts providing OpenGL. </p>
		<p>the OpenGL libraries and associated include files, to wit: </p>
		<p>libGL.a, libGLU.a, libGLw.a -or- libGL.so, libGLU.so, libGLw.so </p>
		<p>the Motif library libXm.a </p>
		<p>the X Window System libraries, libX11.a and libXt.a </p>
		<p>You will also need a 24-bit TrueColor visual, preferably double buffered, <br />
		  available on your machine. You can find out what is available by running <br />
		  xdpyinfo. Also the X server must be running the GLX extension. Extensions <br />
		  are listed near the top of the output of xdpyinfo. </p>
		<p>On some systems, you may need to modify your environmental variable <br />
		  LD_LIBRARY_PATH so that all of the libraries can be found at runtime. </p>
		<p>To *compile* the code, you will need the above stuff plus lasetup source. </p>
		<p>You may have to change the paths in the makefile, depending on where your <br />
		  libraries are located. Similarly, you may have to change the makefiles in <br />
		  each of the lasetup subdirectories. You will also need the include files: </p>
		<p>gl.h, glu.h, glx,h, in /usr/include/GL <br />
		  GLwMDrawA.h, in /usr/include/X11/GLw </p>
		<p>(On Suns these may be in /usr/openwin/include/....). </p>
		<p>***Or*** </p>
		<p>If you don't have OpenGL and are the adventurous type, you can get and compile <br />
		  Brian Paul's Mesa library, to which you can link rather than to OpenGL. <br />
		  See: </p>
		<p>http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~brianp/Mesa.html </p>
		<p>Since Mesa doesn't support hardware even if it's on your machine, the code <br />
		  will run slowly. But this does eliminate the OpenGL requirement. There is <br />
		  a macro MESALIBS in the makefile that you will have to modify, but it might <br />
		  help you get started. I have compiled lasetup with Mesa, so I know it can <br />
		  be done. :)</p>
