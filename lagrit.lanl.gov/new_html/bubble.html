<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This command takes a topologically
2d mesh (a planar or non-planar surface), extrudes it into three dimensions
along either the normal to the surface (default) or along a user defined
vector, and then takes the external surface of the volume created and returns
that to the user.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This operation will result in a closed
surface.</font></blockquote>
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">FORMAT:</font>
<blockquote><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">bubble</font></b>/<font face="Times New Roman,Times">mesh1/mesh2/<b>const|min</b>/</font><font face="Courier New,Courier">offset/</font>[<font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>norm</b>|</font><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">x</font><font face="Courier New,Courier">1,y1,z1]</font></blockquote>
<font face="Courier New,Courier">mesh1</font> <font face="Times New Roman,Times">is
the name of the resulting mesh.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">mesh2 </font>is the name of the initial
mesh. This mesh must be either made up of <b>tris, quads, or hybrids</b>.
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>const</b> is a keyword that indicates
that the distance from each of the points in the initial mesh along the
extruding vector will be equal to offset.Therefore, if you wanted the closed
surface mesh to have the same surface characteristics as the original mesh
on both the initial and newly formed surface or edge, you would use <b>const</b>.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>min</b> is a keyword that indicates
that the minimum distance along the extruding vector to a reference plane
that is perpendicular to the extruding vector will be equal to offset.
This means that if you want a closed surface mesh with at least one flat
side, you would use <b>min</b>. This also means that if you use <b>min</b>,
bubble computes the "bottom point" on the initial mesh, or the point closest
to the reference plane, and then extrudes that point by min, all the other
points will be extruded by a larger distance. This avoids the problem of
having the initial surface intersect the reference plane that forms the
other side of the closed surface mesh.</font>
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">offset</font><font face="Times New Roman,Times">is
the length of extrusion. It can either be an integer or a real.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The final argument is optional. It
must either be the keyword <b>norm</b>, or a three valued vector (in cartesian
space) specifying a direction. The default, if no argument is provided,
is <b>norm</b>. If <b>norm</b> is chosen, the element weighted average
normal to the surface or curve is computed, and the initial mesh is extruded
in that direction. Otherwise, if a vector value is specified, the vector
is normalized, and its direction used to extrude the initial mesh.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">NOTES:</font>
<blockquote><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This code works on meshes
containing quads, triangles, or hybrid polygons.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">It is very possible to create an
invalid mesh object with this command, especially if the initial mesh is
a multivalued surface, or if the extruding vector is in a direction parallel
to the plane that contains the initial surface is in. You have been warned.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">There is an analog to this code that
creates the volume enclosed by the surface as opposed to the surface itself.
It is called <b><a href="extrude.html">extrude.</a></b></font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This code is a wrapper for <b>extrude</b>.
There are plans to integrate <b>bubble</b>'s functionality with <b>extrude</b>
and to eliminate <b>bubble</b> from the command</font>s
<font face="Times New Roman,Times">recognized

<font face="Times New Roman,Times">EXAMPLES:</font>
<blockquote><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">bubble</font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier">/cmo_bigbox/cmo_quad/</font><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">const</font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier">/5.0/</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This would result in a surface surrounding
an amalgamation of parallelopipeds created from the initial quad sheet.
First, since <b>const</b> is used the quads will be extruded a constant
amount from each point in the quad sheet. Second, since the extruding vector
and <b>norm</b> are omitted, the extrusion will occur on the average normal
to the plane. Therefore, this command will result in a mesh of tris that
form the surface of a group of parallelopipeds extruded 5.0 units in an
orthogonal direction.</font>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">bubble</font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier">/cmo_arbshape/cmo_tri/</font><b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">min</font></b><font face="Courier New,Courier">/7.5/3,-2.5,-6</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">This command would result in a mesh
of tris that form a surface enclosing a volume of prisms being created
out of the initial tri sheet. First, since
<b>min</b> is used, the "bottom"
of the surface would be a plane. Second, because the vector 3, -2.5, -6
is specified, the extrusion will be in that direction (again the magnitude
is not important, the vector is normalized to a unit vector), not in the
direction of the average normal of the initial tri surface.</font></blockquote>
