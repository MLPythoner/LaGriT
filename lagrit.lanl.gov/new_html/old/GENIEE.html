<blockquote>Generate element connectivity list (jtet) that gives neighbor
information. Element connectivity is maintained by LaGriT, but can also
be generated by the user with this command.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The jtet attribute contains for each facet of an element the neighboring
element and its local face.&nbsp; For 3D grids the jtet relationship is
reflexsive; each element-face pair has exactly one neighboring element-face
pair.&nbsp; For 2D grids the jtet relationship can include cycles; a triangle
or quad edge may have many edge neighbors.&nbsp; In this case the jtet
is constructed as a closed cycle where the jtet of one element-edge pair
will be a neighboring element-edge pair whose jtet wil be another neighboring
element-edge pair and so on until all neighbors are included in the cycle
exactly once.
<p>The jtet is constructed by looking at matching node numbers and will
use the parent nodes if they exist.&nbsp; Faces with matching node coordinates
but different node numbers will not be matched.
<br>For hybrid grids that contain degenerate elements there are two options.&nbsp;
If the mesh object attribute jtet_reduce_nnd exists and is set to 1, then
faces with repeated node numbers will be matched to faces with the same
numbers but not repeated.&nbsp; For example if a degenerate hex has a face
1 1 2 3 and there is an element (prism, tet, pyramid) with face 1 2 3 and
if jtet_reduce_nnd is 1, then these faces will be matched.&nbsp; Otherwise
they will be marked as external boundary faces.</blockquote>
