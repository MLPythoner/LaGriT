<blockquote><b><u>MASSAGE</u></b>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times"><b>MASSAGE</b> creates, annihilates,
and moves nodes and swaps connections in a 2D or 3D mesh in order to improve
element aspect ratios and establish user-desired edge lengths.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Specifically, <b>MASSAGE</b> performs
up to four iterations of a loop which calls AGD3D (a routine for automated
merging of nodes), RECON (a routine for automated reconnection of edges),
and SGD (a routine for element aspect ratio improvement using smoothing).
<b>MASSAGE</b>
then calls CEL_CHAIN which performs Rivara edge refinement and then another
call to RECON.&nbsp; In the case of 2-D surface grids, this is then followed
by a call to CER_CHAIN which is another edge refinement routine and then
a final call to RECON if necessary.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">AGD3D will attempt to merge edges
that are shorter than MERGE_LENGTH.&nbsp; CEL_CHAIN will attempt to bisect
edges</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">that are longer than BISECTION_LENGTH.&nbsp;
For 2-D surface grids, CER_CHAIN will attempt to bisect edges that deviate
from an averaged surface normal ("have a roughness of") greater than TOLROUGHNESS.
<b>RECON</b>
will attempt to create 'nice' elements by using face swapping.&nbsp; (The
value of the LaGriT IVORONOI parameter determines the meaning of 'nice'.)&nbsp;
SGD will attempt to improve element aspect ratios by moving nodes.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">To ensure that the actions of AGD3D,
RECON, and SGD are controlled and harmonious, the parameter TOLDAMAGE exists,
and there are guidelines for choosing the relative values of BISECTION_LENGTH,
MERGE_LENGTH, TOLDAMAGE, and TOLROUGHNESS.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TOLDAMAGE is a parameter which controls
how much the grid will be deformed by AGD3D, CEL_CHAIN, RECON, and SGD.&nbsp;
The 'damage' is a measure of how much interfaces and external boundaries
are deformed.&nbsp; Roughly, it measures</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">the depths of 'dents' that are invariably
introduced when nodes are moved, annihilated, and faces are swapped.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">We guarantee that the damage of
any single node movement, node annihilation, or face swap is bounded by
TOLDAMAGE.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">So if TOLDAMAGE is set to an extremely
small number, one can expect hardly any node movements, annihilations,
or face swaps will be allowed.&nbsp; Conversely, if TOLDAMAGE is set too
large, physical interfaces may be significantly deformed by the action
of <b>MASSAGE</b>.&nbsp; Experience has shown that setting TOLDAMAGE equal
to approximately .01 times the diameter of the mesh frequently gives acceptable
results.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The guidelines for selecting BISECTION_LENGTH,
MERGE_LENGTH, TOLDAMAGE, and TOLROUGHNESS are as follows.&nbsp; BISECTION_LENGTH
should not be smaller than MERGE_LENGTH, or the action of merging nodes
together will be largely pointless because the newer, longer edges created
by merging will simply be bisected again.&nbsp; In fact, merging all edges
of length > MERGE_LENGTH together can easily create edges of length roughly
3*MERGE_LENGTH in the mesh.&nbsp; Hence it is recommended that BISECTION_LENGTH
be at leastthree times as large as merge length.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Merges of edges of length &lt;= MERGE_LENGTH
are meant to coarsen the mesh, but are not meant to deform surfaces</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">and material interfaces on this
scale.&nbsp; The amount of material/surface deformation (TOLROUGHNESS)
is meant to be considerably less than MERGE_LENGTH.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">On the other hand, the maximum roughness
tolerated in the graph (TOLROUGHNESS) should be considerably more than
TOLDAMAGE, or roughness refinement will be triggered by actions such as
flipping or merging.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Hence, our guidelines for selecting
the parameters are</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">BISECTION_LENGTH >= 3*MERGE_LENGTH
>> TOLDAMAGE</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">AND</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">TOLROUGHNESS >= 10*TOLDMAMAGE&nbsp;
(for 2-D surface grids).</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">For example, for a grid with diameter
of order three, we have used</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">BISECTION_LENGTH, MERGE_LENGTH, TOLDAMAGE,
TOLROUGHNESS =.3, .1, .01, .1</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If one of {BISECTION_LENGTH, MERGE_LENGTH}
is omitted, the omitted one will be set so that BISECTION_LENGTH=3*MERGE_LENGTH.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If they are both omitted, they will
both be taken to be infinity.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If TOLDAMAGE is not specified, no
node annihilation will take place.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">IF TOLROUGHNESS is not specified,
no refinement on roughness will occur and thus the format is compatible
with old decks where refinement on roughness did not occur.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">The final, optional argument can
be one or more of <b>NOSMOOTH</b>, <b>LITE, IGNOREMATS, STRICTMERGELENGTH</b>,

<b>CHECKAXY</b>, <b>SEMIEXCLUSIVE</b>, and <b>EXCLUSIVE.&nbsp; NOSMOOTH</b>
causes <b>MASSAGE</b> to deviate from the above description, in that node
smoothing by SGD is not performed.&nbsp; If <b>LITE</b> is specified, only
one iteration of the merging/reconnection/smoothing loop is executed, and
a reconnection after edge refinement is</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">omitted.&nbsp; This is suitable
for applications, such as Gradient Weighted Moving Finite Elements, where
<b>MASSAGE</b>
is called repeatedly.The optional argument <b>IGNOREMATS</b> causes <b>MASSAGE</b>
to process the multimaterial mesh in a single material mode; it ignores
the material interfaces.&nbsp; The optional argument <b>STRICTMERGELENGTH</b>
forces strict interpretation of MERGE_LENGTH so that there is no merging
along the edges of flat elements.&nbsp; This is important if <b>IGNOREMATS</b>
is specified to avoid losing the interfaces.</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">If <b>CHECKAXY</b> is given, then
we insure that for 2D meshes, the output mesh will have positive xy-projected
triangle areas,</font>
<br><font face="Times New Roman,Times">provided that the input mesh had
them in the first place.</font>&nbsp;&nbsp; If <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">EXCLUSIVE</font></b>
is given, then edge refinement operations will only
<br>be performed on edges whose endpoints are <i>both</i> in the PSET that
<b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">MASSAGE</font></b> is working on.&nbsp;
(As usual, new nodes created by refinement are added to the PSET so that
<b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">MASSAGE</font></b> can refine edges
recursively.)&nbsp; The default behavior is 'inclusive', where only ONE
edge endpoint has to belong to the PSET for the edge to be eligible for
refinement. If <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">SEMIEXCLUSIVE</font></b>
is given, refinement will only be triggered by edges with both endpoints
in the PSET, but some edges with less than
<br>two endpoints in the PSET might be refined as part of a 'Rivara chain'
triggered by the refinement of an edge with both
<br>endpoints in the PSET.&nbsp; This represents an intermediate case between
'inclusive'&nbsp; and <b><font face="Times New Roman,Times">EXCLUSIVE</font></b>.
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Note:&nbsp; Since CEL_CHAIN is called
only once at the end of <b>MASSAGE</b>, it may be necessary to call <b>MASSAGE</b>
twice for optimal results.&nbsp; This is because annihilation of nodes
is done with an intent to improve element aspect ratios, but cannot be
effective if there are too few nodes initially.</font>
<p><font face="Times New Roman,Times">Note: The user may wish to issue
a "<b>RMPOINT/COMPRESS</b>" after <b>MASSAGE </b>operations that merge
a significant number of nodes.</font>
