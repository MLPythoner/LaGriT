            <td>Orientation-dependence of the grain boundary energy between grains 3 <br />
              and 4 of Figure 1. The figure has the same orientation as Figure 1. The <br />
              direction to the surface from the center is the direction of the grain <br />
              boundary normal, and the length of the vector (and color of the <br />
              surface) gives the magnitude.&nbsp; This surface is different for each grain pair since it <br />
              is a function of their relative orientations as well as the grain boundary normal dependence shown here. <br />
              The interactionwith the boundary for this simulation was chosen to be grain and <br />
              orientation independent. The grains have fcc symmetry and the <br />
              parameters were chosen to approximate Copper. We are currently <br />
              investigating ways to more accurately model the orientation dependence <br />
            within the scope of the finite element calculation.</td>
