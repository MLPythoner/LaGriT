The direction to the surface from the center is the direction of the grain boundary normal, and the length of the vector (and color of the surface) gives the magnitude.&nbsp; This surface is different for each grain pair since it is a function of their relative orientations as well as the grain boundary normal dependence shown here. The interactionwith the boundary for this simulation was chosen to be grain and orientation independent. The grains have fcc symmetry and the parameters were chosen to approximate Copper. We are currently investigating ways to more accurately model the orientation dependence within the scope of the finite element calculation.</p></td>
